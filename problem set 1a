#pset 1a "house hunting"
#1. Call the cost of your dream home total_cost.
#2. Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment. For
#simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).
#3. Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings. You start with a current savings of $0. 
#4. Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual return of r (in other words,
#at the end of each month, you receive an additional current_savings*r/12 funds to put into
#your savings â€“ the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (4%).
#5. Assume your annual salary is annual_salary.
#6. Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for 
#the down payment. Call that portion_saved. This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1 for 10%). 
#7. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment,
#plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).
#Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you to save up enough money for a down payment.

RESULT EXAMPLE:
How much does your dream home cost? 300000
What percent is your down payment? Ex .25 = 25% .2
What is your annual salary? 99000
Enter percentage as decimal of your salary you will save. Ex: 0.2 is 20% .3
Number of months: 26
Number of years: 2.1666666666666665
Downpayment amount available at month 26 :   62081.25
